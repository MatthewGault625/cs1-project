# cs1-project
CSCI 1370 | The final project that we worked on as a group for our Computer Science 1 course in which we created a ticket manager system using classes in C++. The ticket manager program reads from the files of the seat result, seat availability, and seat prices files in order to display in the terminal and output file what are the selected seats in the theater and also the prices of said tickets. This program can be run in Microsoft Visual Studio or other IDEs that support C++.
